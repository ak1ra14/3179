        <div ><p>Mental health issues have become increasingly prevalent, with approximately <b>1 in 5 adults</b>
            experiencing a mental health condition each year. Anxiety and depression are among the most 
            common disorders, affecting millions globally. Recent studies indicate that over <b>264 million
            people suffer from depression</b>, while anxiety disorders impact around 284 million individuals. 
            The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, highlighting the urgent need for 
            awareness and improved access to mental health resources and support systems.</p></div>

                <p >The dashboard reveals intriguing patterns between GDP per capita and the prevalence of anxiety 
                disorders across different countries. While it&#39s often assumed that higher GDP correlates with 
                lower rates of mental health disorders due to better access to healthcare, the data suggests a 
                more nuanced story. Some wealthier nations still report substantial levels of anxiety, challenging 
                the notion that economic success alone leads to better mental health outcomes. On the other hand, 
                certain countries with lower GDP exhibit surprisingly lower anxiety rates, suggesting the influence 
                of other factors like cultural attitudes or community support.</p>
